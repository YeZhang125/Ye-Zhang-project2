What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
One of the biggest challenges in creating this app was designing the components in a way that they interact seamlessly, 
while ensuring the gameâ€™s core functionality worked as expected. 
A particular focus was on the "Auto Clear" feature,
which involved clearing adjacent non-mined cells. 
Implementing this feature required carefully structured logic to check neighboring cells recursively, 
without affecting performance or creating infinite loops, 
which was both challenging and rewarding.




Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
I would enhance the app with a "Saved Data" feature. This would allow users to save their game progress, 
enabling them to return later without losing their current game state. 



What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
For this project, I assumed that mobile screens would have a width of 576 pixels or less. 
This informed my design choices, especially regarding responsiveness and layout adjustments for smaller screens.


How long did this assignment take to complete?
15 hours.
